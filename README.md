Udacity Robotics Engineer Nanodegree Project Submission: 3D Perception

## Overview
This repository contains the code and report for a piece of coursework submitted for the Udacity Robotics Engineer Nanodegree. In this project, I develop a pipeline to process point cloud data, to allow a robot to recognise objects within a scene.

## Files

<b>3d-perception.ipynb</b> - A short IPython notebook that describes the approach to the project, and includes areas for improvement.

<b>images</b> - A folder of images that are used within the writeup.
